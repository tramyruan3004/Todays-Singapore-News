                <h1>Infocomm Security</h1>
                <h2>What exactly DISM is about? </h2>
                <p>As the world grows, the internet has become an integral part of today’s generation of people; from communicating through instant messages and emails to banking, travelling, studying and shopping, the internet has touched every aspect of life. Hence, protecting critical information has become a necessity. A computer that does not have proper security controls can be infected with malicious logic. The cybercriminals would take advantage of this to gain illegal access to other computer systems for their own merits. The more we rely on the internet to store and manage important information, the more we need to keep it safe from cybercriminals. 
                <br>
                <br>
                From opening an email attachment that carries the virus to clicking a scam link or website to downloading a dangerous program, there are numerous ways to gain unauthorized access to a computer. This way,  any computer can be infected, and information can be accessed at any moments. This is why cybersecurity becomes vital in our modern internet age. The Diploma in Infocomm Security Management course offers a curriculum covering the critical areas of <b>security technology, security management, information technology, law, teamwork and communications</b>. This provides students with a holistic approach towards cybersecurity and many opportunities within the institution and out in society. There is a say, "True cybersecurity is preparing for what's next, not what was last" by Neil Rerup. Indeed, as long as people are still using the internet, cyber attacks will never stop. Hence cybersecurity has become even more critical in today life.</p>

                <h1>Why DISM?</h1>
                <p>Besides the importance of cybersecurity, I chose DISM as my course in polytechnic because
                    <li>the cybersecurity industry presents the ultimate growth potential. I believe that a great cybersecurity professional is aware that learning never stops. This is a massive opportunity to stay engaged and challenged.</li>
                    <li>DISM offers various career paths; security professionals get the chance to work directly with teams on technologies and systems they never dreamed of. From robots to cars to websites serving millions and millions of users, the variety is near infinite.</li>
                    <li>I believe that coding and programming would soon become essential skills in the future and I wanted to know more about the industry.</li>

                <h1>My cybersecurity career path</h1>
                <p>There are four levels in the industry in the cybersecurity career path: feeder roles, entry-level, intermediate level and senior level. My final goal is to become a Cybersecurity Architect. Cybersecurity architects are responsible for designing, building, deploying and testing information security systems within an IT network. It is one of the three core advanced-level cybersecurity roles besides cybersecurity administrator and cybersecurity engineer. Besides, a cybersecurity architect manages complex information security systems within an organisation to meet its security requirements. Besides the hard skills, soft skills such as teaching, communication, and persuasion are also crucial. Once the system has been designed and built, the cybersecurity architect would focus on testing, monitoring, and assessments. Prototyping, updating and upgrading the system are things that a cybersecurity architect has to keep track of as time passes to stay up-to-date in defending against the latest threats. 
                <br>
                <br>
                My career path: <b>Associate Cybersecurity Analyst &rarr; Application Security Engineer &rarr; Principal Application Security Engineer &rarr; Chief Cybersecurity Architect</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                My goal after Chief Cybersecurity Architect: to become chief executive officer of my own company. It can be about cybersecurity or anything that I am interested in at that period of time.
