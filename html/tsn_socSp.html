                On the first day of school, I entered the school campus with new hopes and aspirations. In order to enter our campus - Singapore polytechnic, we have to tap our student card to the gate machines, which makes me feel like we are coming to the office buildings to work. I had some very strange experiences on the first day of polytechnic life. There is no restriction of uniform; the students can do things according to their choices. I found all the newly admitted students in high spirits. At first, I was shy to make new friends, but they were all happy to make friends despite the awkwardness of the first time meeting one another.</p>

                The lesson style is very different from secondary school. There is no more morning assembly, no need to ask permission to go toilet, no more fixed timing to leave the school. Some days, we can come to school later; some days, we can leave early. Basically, we are treated as young adults. However, there is something in common: we have weekly quizzes and mid-semester exams for some modules, although we do more projects than before. The lecturers are very friendly, any questions during lectures are asked during break times and at the end of lectures. Everything is fine and fun for me until now.</p>

                        For my first semester in polytechnic, I am taking four core modules: Fundamentals of Programming, Fundamentals of Computing, Front-End web development and Communicating for Project Effectiveness (Proposal). We are required to work together on some projects; luckily, my teammates are all cooperative, and we make a good team so far.

                        The classes in poly are conducted differently from the secondary. All the learning materials are posted on the school's blackboard, and we are encouraged to read through the notes and tutorials before classes. This helps the students to learn how to manage time well and do plan properly. </p>

                        Before entering poly, I only had a bit basic of Python - a programming language, and at school, we are learning JavaScript - another programming language. This programming language is quite versatile as we can apply it to our daily life. In another module, Fundamentals of Computing, we are learning about how the network and computers work. For Front-End web development, we can design our websites and figure out how the websites function. We also practice our writing skills in Communicating for Project Effectiveness classes, where we learn how to plan and propose our project.  I believe that these are the most exciting and applicable things one can learn.</p>

                        The school has various clubs and CCAs that the students can join. I am in the DISM Gryphons club; here, I can organise CTP competition in different areas in cybersecurity. Besides, I have been playing bowling for three years so I would like to join the bowling club. However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the sport CCAs' trial was all cancelled.</p>
