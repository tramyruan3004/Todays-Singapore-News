                <p id="one">As a child, I was always jealous of friends around my age. I was born in Guangdong, China, so Cantonese became my first mother tongue, then I went to a Mandarin-speaking preschool. This changed my first language to Mandarin. My life was going quite smooth as both languages are relatively similar for me; however, when I was six, my family moved to Vietnam - my father's home town. Indeed, the language barrier becomes the greatest challenge to me; especially I could hardly communicate with my memaw in my daily life. From memorising the Vietnamese alphabets to forming a complete word, everything seemed challenging.
                <br>
                <br>
                Nevertheless, I did not feel hopeless as my parents and family tried to spend time teaching me the language. I soon managed to make close friendships. I learned the importance of tenacity and hard-working. Then I continued my journey of learning a new language - English in Singapore. Learning English had never been the most challenging thing ever in my life till I got to know about the GCE-O level.</p>

                <p id="two">At a young age, I was always fascinated by coding and cybersecurity. As the world grows, I realised how cybercrimes could wreak havoc on the world and understood the importance of cybersecurity in an ever-evolving high-tech world. My adventure began at 15 when I went abroad for my studies, not to any place but to where I have always dreamed of going since I was little: to Singapore, but the course that marked this stage of my life was when I started my life in Infocomm Security Management <span>(DISM)</span> at Singapore Polytechnic.
                <br>
                <br>
                Besides my academic achievement, engaging in other activities such as playing sports, joining summer camps, hanging out with friends also help me acquire wilderness knowledge and skills that may not be taught in school. These skills can be time management, communication with others, cooperation with my teammates, and providing a balanced education. I like to spend my free time adopting new programming languages as well. Writing code and creating my own programs and website is the most interesting and exciting thing ever.</p>
